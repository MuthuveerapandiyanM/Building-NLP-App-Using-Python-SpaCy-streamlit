# NLP-App-Using-Python-SpaCy-streamlit

In this Project, we will demonstrate how we can build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based web application consisting of advanced text summarization, named entity recognizer, sentiment analysis and text completion. For building this web app, we have used spacy-streamlit library which is a very effective package for visualizing the Spacy model and building an interactive web app with Streamlit.

# Installation
